               <h1>Background</h1>
               <p>It all started when I found a helpless kitten at a gas station near my house in the middle of the night.
               As I was getting out of my car I noticed these people holding the gas station doors open and trying to shoo something out with a broom. 
               Based on their reactions I assumed it was a rat or something. When I entered the gas station I noticed a skinny little orange kitten going from person to person, meowing a squeaky little meow, begging to be noticed. 
               The people there treated him like he was pest, even the attendant was shouting at him to leave. The little guy couldn't be more than 4 weeks old, he was clearly hungry. and there was no Mama in sight.
               I couldn't bear to leave the kitten alone, so him brought him home with me.</p>
               <p>I remember my roomate had mentioned wanting a little ginger girl kitty to be a companion for his kitty that he'd rescued a year previous. It was about 2 AM when I pulled into the driveway, we had been up late studying and the has station trip was for energy drinks. 
               I called him to meet me outside it was an emergency! He thought something was wrong and ran out to my car, where I handed him the little guy and he immediately fell in love.
               We bathed him, fed him, and took him to the vet the next morning to make sure he was okay. Of course he adopted him, we named him Ollie, and the little guy was right at home. </p>
               <p><br>A few weeks go by, when one afternoon I was studying from my second story bedroom when I noticed something moving in the leaves below my window. I went to investigate when a little white and tan kitten bolted from the leaf pile and tried to get through the chainlink fence, 
               but instead found himself stuck in said fence. He was even tinier than Ollie was when I found him. I carefully plucked his trembling little body from the fence and
               brought him inside. After a bath and a nice big meal, he quickly warmed up to me.  After a trip to the vet we searched and searched for his Mama and his siblings with no luck. 
               He stole my heart very quickly and I couldn not help but adopt the little sweetheart. I named him Bunny, or Bun Bun, after the way he sprung from the leaf pile</p>
               <p>Another few weeks go by when my roommate and I start to hear faint meows around our house, our ears had become accustomed to kitten meows, so we were on high alert. 
               We couldnt find them at first, but we knew there was a cat colony living near our house, so we started to put out food to help them. We had seen multiple neighborhood cats in the area and figured one of them must be the mama. 
               However, the food attracted more cats to our porch than we expected. They started to get comforatble coming to see us and made our porch their official hangout. 
               It wasn’t long before we discovered the kittens were living under our porch. It wasn’t safe for them considering the amount of cat killing dogs lurking in our neighborhood. 
               We wanted to help and quickly realized that we needed to save the kittens before they were old enough to start running the neighborhood on their own.</p>
               <p>Underneath our porch isn't exactly accesible, but we managed to use cameras and skill to safely remove each kitten. We took the kittens to KC Pet Project where we learned more about cat colonies and their TNR clinic. 
               The kittens received medical care and we were advised to try and get the Mama as they were too young to be away from her yet. The vet explained how live traps work, so purchased one from Home Depot and got a kitten nursery ready for Mom and her babies. \
               She was very much a feral cat that did not like to be too close to humans, so with that in mind, we set the trap. We managed to get her after multiple failed attempts we caught her and reunited her with her kittens in a room just for them with all the cat amenities to properly care for her babies. </p>
               <p>It didn’t take long before we found another cat from her colony with kittens about the same age, we caught her and her babies and put them together where they happily co-parented. We even gained both their trust and became friends with them! It took some time but we did find happy homes for each kitten when the time was right. 
               We knew the Mamas missed their colonies and they simply weren’t fit for adoption or to live inside.</p>
               <p>From there, we started researching what to do for them and for future kittens and we remebered KCPP has a TNR program (Trap-Neuter-Return) which aims to reduce the number of stray cats on the streets.</p>
               <p>For a small fee, both Mama cats were fixed, microchipped, and received their shots. They tipped their ears to show they were TNR cats and not strays, and we let back out to rejoin their colony. After a few more litters of kittens and a lot of time and effort, we managed to TNR the entire colony.</p>
               <p>Word spread about our efforts, and eventually, people on social media started reaching out to us for help with the kittens they found. We became known as the go-to people for helping stray kittens in our area. It was a lot of hard work, but we found it incredibly fulfilling to help these animals and make a positive impact on your community. 
               To date we have rescued and found homes for over 60 cats and kittens.</p>

               <h1><br>Community Cats</h1>
               <p id = "testP" class = "funParagraph">A kitten born outside faces many challenges and struggles for survival. These kittens are often born to feral cats or to cats that have been abandoned or lost. They are known as community cats, and they form colonies of cats that live together in outdoor habitats. 
               The chances of survival for these kittens are low, as they are vulnerable to disease, starvation, and predation. They may also suffer from injuries, such as broken bones, and can face harsh weather conditions. Without human intervention, their life expectancy is relatively short.
               <br><br>Kittens born outside may not have the opportunity to learn to trust and love humans, as they are not socialized to humans at a young age. However, with patience, love, and proper socialization techniques, it is possible to build a relationship with these cats and even adopt them into loving homes.
               It is essential to treat community cats with love and compassion, as they are sentient beings that deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. Community cats can benefit from TNR programs, which help to control their population and prevent the suffering of kittens and cats in the wild. </p>

               <h1>Trap-Neuter-Return</h1>
               <p>TNR, or trap-neuter-return, is an important method for controlling the population of feral cats and helps by preventing the suffering of kittens and cats in the wild. Feral cats are either formely domestic cats that have returned to the wild or cats that were born into a cat colony outdoors and are not socialized to humans. 
               TNR works by humanely trapping these cats, having them spayed or neutered, vaccinated, and then releasing them back into their environment. This approach helps to manage the population of feral cats without resorting to euthanasia, which can be cruel and ineffective.</p>
               <p>Indoor cats have a life expectancy of 12-17 years, unlike outdoor cats that have only have a life expectancy of 1-5 years. They can suffer from starvation, disease, and injury, and their population can quickly become unmanageable.
               TNR not only helps to prevent the suffering of feral cats but also benefits the community and domestic cats. By reducing the population of feral cats, TNR can help reduce the incidence of cat-related problems such as noise, odor, and property damage. It can also reduce the risk of disease transmission between cats, including diseases that can be transmitted to humans.</p>

               <h1>How You Can Help</h1>
               <div class="funParagraph">
               <p>Many animal welfare organizations and community groups support TNR as an alternative to ineffective and inhumane methods such as trap-and-kill or relocation. You can help support TNR by volunteering with local TNR programs, donating to TNR efforts, and spreading awareness about the benefits of TNR.
               Getting involved in TNR is a great way to help cats in need. You can start by contacting local animal shelters or rescue organizations to find out if they have a TNR program. 
               If there isn't a program in your area, consider starting one yourself. TNR requires some training and resources, but there are many resources available to help you get started. By participating in TNR, 
               you can help prevent the suffering of countless innocent kittens and improve the lives of feral cats in your community.</p>
